# Optimized Feature Selection

This project was created as part of the lecture "Selbstorganisierende und adaptive Systeme"
at the University of Duisburg-Essen. It's provides a service for findung an
optimized configuration for a feature tree using the 
[regulatory algorithm](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-015-1624-6).

You need to send your feature tree including some information about the impact
between features and softgoals. Furthermore, you can configure the algorithm
(e.g. the probability for a mutation or the quota of reproduction).
